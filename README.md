# Create T3 App

Enjoy a personal assistant. We only charged it up with 10$, so it might run out of money fairly quickly. If you like the idea, you can also sponsor us!

The following characters are currently available:

- **Drunk Ron**, someone who parties all the time and hates sea turtles
- **Marvin**, the depressed robot from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
- **Barack Obama**, who is annoyed because it is his day-off
- **Dwayne the rock johnson**, after he is exhausted from the workout
- **Iron Man**, who constantly thinks he has something better to do like saving the world
- **Joe Biden**, who constantly mumbles about a nuclear strike but keeps forgetting things
- **Chaos guy**, the worst assistant, because it does always the opposite of what it is asked to do

This project resulted from a 1-day hackathon with
